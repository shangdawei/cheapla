CheapLA aims to provide a logic analyzer based on cheap off-the-shelf FPGA kits. Initial targets are the $150 Spartan 3E-Starter Kit and the Spartan 3A-Starter Kit. CheapLA uses a combination of fast embedded BlockRAM and "slow" external DDR2-SDRAM to provide up to 32MB (or more, depending on the hardware) storage for samples, while still being able to capture short burst at >100 Mhz sampling rate. It provides a network interface (using HTTP) to allow remote control from a PC, and a fast transfer of the captures data.
