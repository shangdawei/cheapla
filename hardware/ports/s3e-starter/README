This port is based on a default config for the Xilinx/Digilent Spartan3E Starter Kit:

It uses 32 of the GPIO pins on the Hirose FX2 connector as inputs.

It has 32M of 16bit x 133Mhz DDR-SDRAM, which we underclock to about 120MHz 
to get better timing results in the LA core. This, of course, needs to be fixed.

It would also be nice to support the LEDs or LCD to display status.
