This is a lwip-based httpd which tries to be somewhat more compliant than the
original LWIP sample. It can handle all sort of request, given proper coder's
skills.

It uses limited buffering (usually some hundred bytes) to draw the fine line
between pure event driven parsers and bloated "let's eat everything first"
servers. It - of course - uses the great lwip callback api.

It also includes a simple engine to postprocess otherwise static files with
dynamic information. But you can always write your own handler.
